    "Welcome to part A of the Frequentist inference case study! The purpose of this case study is to help you apply the concepts associated with Frequentist inference in Python. Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In particular, you'll practice writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts: \n",
    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences\n",
    "* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample\n",
    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",
    "* how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval"

In standard statistical\\n    practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an unbiased estimator of the variance\\n    of the infinite population. ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood\\n    estimate of the variance for normally distributed variables. The\\n    standard deviation computed in this function is the square root of\\n    the estimated variance, so even with ``ddof=1``, it will not be an\\n    unbiased estimate of the standard deviation per se.\\n\\n    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute\\n    value before squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.\\n\\n    For floating-point input, the *std* is computed using the same\\n    precision the input has. Depending on the input data, this can cause\\n    the results to be inaccurate, especially for float32 (see example below).\\n    Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the `dtype` keyword can\\n    alleviate this issue.\\n\\n    Examples\\n    --------\\n    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\\n    >>> np.std(a)\\n    1.1180339887498949 # may vary\\n    >>> np.std(a, axis=0)\\n    array([1.,  1.])\\n    >>> np.std(a, axis=1)\\n    array([0.5,  0.5])\\n\\n    In single precision, std() can be inaccurate:\\n\\n    >>> a = np.zeros((2, 512*512), dtype=np.float32)\\n    >>> a[0, :] = 1.0\\n    >>> a[1, :] = 0.1\\n    >>> np.std(a)\\n    0.45000005\\n\\n    Computing the standard deviation in float64 is more accurate:\\n\\n    >>> np.std(a, dtype=np.float64)\\n    0.44999999925494177 # may vary\\n\\n    \""

You've calculated the average (the mean) of this sample and seen that this is not exactly equal to the expected population parameter (which we know because we're generating the random variates from a specific, known distribution). You've been introduced to two ways of calculating the standard deviation; one uses $n$ in the denominator and the other uses $n-1$ (Bessel's correction). You've also seen which of these calculations np.std() performs by default and how to get it to generate the other."

We can think of this population as an imaginary space of possibilities. \n",

    "So far we've been dealing with the concept of taking a sample from a population to infer the population parameters. One statistic we calculated for a sample was the mean. As our samples will be expected to vary from one draw to another, so will our sample statistics. If we were to perform repeat draws of size $n$ and calculate the mean of each, we would expect to obtain a distribution of values. This is the sampling distribution of the mean. **The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** tells us that such a distribution will approach a normal distribution as $n$ increases (the intuitions behind the CLT are covered in full on p. 236 of *AoS*). For the sampling distribution of the mean, the standard deviation of this distribution is given by\n",

From this sample, we want to make inferences about the population.

This is the key driver for us 'requiring' a certain sample size, for example you may frequently see a minimum sample size of 30 stated in many places.
